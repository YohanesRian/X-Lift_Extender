# X-Lift_Extender

X-Lift is an extension of an elevator to be smarter because it uses a real-time database. Through the X-Lift, the elevator can only be accessed by certain people with access. Thus, buildings with X-Lifts in elevators can be more secure and modular than elevator extensions that rely on card data. This project is modular and can be customized based on certain conditions according to the building owner's needs.
